# Sensor_Fusion_Optimization
This project fuses RGB and Thermal Imaging to detect hot/burning objects.
- RGB Imaging is done with the ESP32-CAM.
- Thermal Imaging is done with Adafruit's AMG8833 module.
- To optimize the FOV and detection area of the dual sensing system, you can use the Optimizer.py code to conduct all the calculations.
